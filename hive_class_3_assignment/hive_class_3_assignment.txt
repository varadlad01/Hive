Ans -
load data inpath '/data/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_data_csv;


5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
Ans - 

create table sales_order_data_orc
(

)
stored as orc;


6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
Ans - 
insert overwrite table sales_order_data_orc select * from sales_order_data_csv;


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculate total sales per year
Ans - 
select year_id,sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_data_orc group by year_id;


b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
Ans - 
select productline product,max(quantityordered) orders_placed from sales_order_data_orc group by productline order by productline limit 1;


c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
Ans - 
select qtr_id,sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_data_orc group by qtr_id;


d. In which quarter sales was minimum
Ans - 
select qtr_id,sum(sales) as total_quater_sale from sales_order_data_orc group by qtr_id order by total_quater_sale limit 1;


e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
Ans - 
select country, sum(sales) total_sales from sales_order_data_orc group by country order by total_sales desc limit 1 
union all select country, sum(sales) total_sales from sales_order_data_orc group by country order by total_sales limit 1;


f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
Ans - 
select qtr_id,sum(sales) quaterly_sales from sales_order_data_orc group by qtr_id;


h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
Ans - 
select distinct year_id,month_id,quantityordered from (select year_id,month_id,quantityordered,
dense_rank() over(partition by year_id order by quantityordered desc) as rn from sales_order_data_orc)as a where rn=1;
